				<a href="#panel1" >What is jujutsu?</a>
				<div id="panel1" class="content active"><p>
            There's two main types of jujitsu: Brazilian, and Japanase. The Ohio State Jujitsu Club is officially a Japanese Jujitsu club, but we also incorporate large amounts of Brazilian. Japanese Jujitsu originated in feudal Japan as a way for the samurai to fight other armored combatants. Since punching and kicking is much less effective against someone wearing armor, jujitsu focuses on throws, joint locks, holds, chokes, and other more brutal techniques such as gouging and biting. These days, those more brutal techniques are no longer taught in modern sport jujitsu. Japanese jujitsu is an ancestor to many other martial arts such as Judo, Sambo, Aikido, and of course Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
            <br><br>
            So what's the difference between Brazilian Jiu-jitsu and Japanese Jujitsu? As mentioned before, the Japanese version was created by the samurai so it has a larger focus on fighting while standing. Brazilian, on the other hand, has a much larger focus on ground fighting. If you've ever watched a UFC fight, the fighting on the ground was likely Brazilian jiu-jitsu. 
            <br><br>  
            Both martial arts focus largely on the use of proper technique instead of brute force. That is to say, a small, well-trained jujitsu practitioner is able to compete with larger, less skilled opponets.

        <a href="#panel4" >How are classes structured?</a>
        <div id="panel4" class="content active"><p>
            Generally, classes start with a brief warm up which can varies between some combination of cardio, strength, stretching, and tumbling. The warm up is followed by the sensei demonstrates a series of techniques to the class which we then practice in pairs or small groups. These techniques will often build off of each other. Finally, the class ends with a few rounds of rolling which is essentially the grappling equivalent to sparring.

				<a href="#panel2" >Do I need to be in shape?</a>
				<div id="panel2" class="content active"><p>
            In short, no! While it does help tremendously to be in as good of shape as you possibly can, it is entirely possibly to begin learing techniques without any prior conditioning. As mentioned above, jujitsu focuses more on proper technique than brute force, conditioning, and explosiveness. Each of our classes begins with a warm-up and stretching. Jujitsu is a great way to get in shape and have fun while doing it.

				<a href="#panel3" >Do I need prior martial arts experience?</a>
				<div id="panel3" class="content active"><p>
          Not at all! Those of you that have experience in other grappling martial arts such as wresting or judo will of course have a head start over someone who is completely new to grappling. Regardless of skill level, our members are all great about welcoming in new members and helping each other progress in skill.

				<a href="#panel4" >How long will it take to get a black belt?</a>
				<div id="panel4" class="content active"><p>
            On average, it takes about 11 years of training to receive a black belt. There are of course outliers such as BJ Penn, the former Lightweight Champion of the UFC, who received his black belt in less than 3 years. Check out the <a href="About.HTML">Belt System</a> section of our About page for more information on each of the belts.

        <a href="#panel5" >Will it help me in a street fight?</a>
        <div id="panel5" class="content active"><p>
            Maybe. The club that will give you the best chance in a street fight is by far the <a href="http://running.org.ohio-state.edu/">running club</a>. Unless your name is Bruce Wayne, your best option both in terms of safety and legalality is to run away. Take for instance the story of <a href="http://www.myfoxatlanta.com/story/18430877/martial-arts-champion-killed-in-shooting-at-drive-in">Mitt Lenix</a>, a Junior Olympic world champion in taekwondo who was shot and killed at a drive-in movie theater. Even if you do win a street fight, there are all sorts of legal repurcussions to deal with afterwards. Martial arts should only be used if you get into a position where neither the <a href="http://running.org.ohio-state.edu/">running club</a> or the parkour club can help you.
            <br><br>
            With all of that said, ju-jitsu is one of the better martial arts to know in a fight. A fairly large percentage of fights end up on the ground at one point or another* and ju-jitsu is one of the best martial arts for ground fighting as evidenced by its prevalence in the UFC. We also do live rolling (the grappling equivalent of sparring) at the end of every practice to help with integrating the skills learned in class into actual competition. As mentioned elsewhere, this club does not focus souly on ground fighting, but also striking and throws / takedowns. That is to say, you will be able to defend yourself adequately assuming it is a fair, one-on-one fight with no weapons (including ad hoc weapons such as broken bottles and such), with no threat on legal action afterwards.
            <br><br>
            *The claim that 90% of fights end up on the ground has little evidence supporting it.
